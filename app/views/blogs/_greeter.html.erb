<h1>Welcome to LiveLCA</h1>
  
<p style="font-size:16px">
  LiveLCA is a platform for all people to get a view into their daily CO2 spendings. The platform provides data on food in various food groups and the database keeps growing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  You can use LiveLCA to calculate the CO2 emissions from recipes, settle disputes with your friends or simply as a reference work.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  By making LiveLCA publicly available, we hope that people will be able to make more conscious choices when buying products and potentially decrease their personal emissions.
