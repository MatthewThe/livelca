<h1>About</h1>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  LiveLCA is a platform for all people to get a view into their daily CO2 spendings. The platform provides data on food in various food groups and the database keeps growing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  You can use LiveLCA to calculate the CO2 emissions from recipes, settle disputes with your friends or simply as a reference work.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  By making LiveLCA publicly available, we hope that people will be able to make more conscious choices when buying products and potentially decrease their personal emissions.

<h2>History</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  LiveLCA was founded by us, Matthew and Ditte, based on our common interest in cooking and sustainable living. 
Over the years we reduced meat in our diet to live a more sustainable life. However, we were missing specific scientific data to back up our choices and also data for optimizing our sustainable lifestyle even more.
We therefore decided to analyze our own consumption, collect various sources and are now ready to calculate our own emissions.
We believe that everybody should be able to have access to the information and now decided to make our efforts publicly available.
